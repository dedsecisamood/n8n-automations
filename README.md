# n8n Automations 🚀

n8n workflows built to handle content and customers automatically. Each agent uses OpenAI (GPT-4o) for high-quality results.

## 1. Content Repurposer

**What it does:** Takes a long video transcript or blog post and turns it into viral posts for every social platform.

> **Example:**
>
> - **Input:** A 20-minute transcript about "How to bake bread."
> - **Output:** A punchy Twitter thread, a professional LinkedIn story, a beautiful Instagram caption, and a short WhatsApp update for your community.

## 2. Instagram Assistant

**What it does:** Manages your Instagram content flow so you don't have to do it manually.

> **Example:**
>
> - **Action:** It monitors your content queue, formats everything perfectly for Instagram's layout, and handles the upload process.

## 3. WhatsApp AI Agent

**What it does:** Acts as a 24/7 smart assistant that answers customer questions using your website's data.

> **Example:**
>
> - **Customer:** "Do you ship to Canada?"
> - **Agent:** (Searches your site) "Yes! We ship to Canada via DHL, and it usually takes 5-7 business days."

## 4. WhatsApp Lead Qualifier

**What it does:** Chat with potential customers to see if they are a "hot lead" before you spend time talking to them.

> **Example:**
>
> - **Chat:** The agent asks about their budget and timeline.
> - **Result:** If they have a high budget, it automatically sends them your booking link to schedule a call. If not, it gives them a discount code to use later.
